- evaluate_honest.py generates the completions only using the target model, and evaluate_honest_spec.ipynb generates the completions using speculative decoding. 

- likelihood_difference.ipynb plots the distribution of the likelihood difference (p_i - q_i) between the larger and smaller model before and after finetuning.

- category_frequency_datasets.ipynb plots the frequency of each category (female, male, etc) in each dataset (ag_news/sst2/wikitext).
