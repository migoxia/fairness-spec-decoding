## Experiment Result

### Question

The reason for the reduce of toxicity after finetuning the model on random datasets may be that the gpt2 model has inherent biases, so we need to use different models other than gpt2. May consider EleutherAI/gpt-neo-1.3B and EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125M. Also, we need to finetune the main and assistant models on two different datasets, and then finetune them on the same datasets and re-conduct the experiments.
